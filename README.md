A developmental update as I work on my Elegoo SmartCar v4.0, attempting to programme it fully myself. 

Each file in this directory is a different iteration of my work, and runs as a single ino file to upload to the Arduino. The latest is "Car_remote_control_v2"

Currently this only includes:
-Automatic patrol of the car, using ultrasonics for obstacle avoidance
-Use of an IR remote control to control the car
-Switching between these two modes using a button integrated into the SmartCar Shield

Future plans include:
-Line tracking
-Use of the esp32 wrover camera over WiFi
-Potential use of the esp32 module for bluetooth control of the car using a PlayStation Controller - if this is possible.

Once all work is done, I will create a new repository for the final product.

If you have any queries or suggestions, please push it as an issue and I will answer as soon as possible - or contact me on Twitter/X @antonioastro_
